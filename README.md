# COMP702 Leaf Classification Project

Required libraries:
1. Pytorch (check https://pytorch.org/ to easily build a terminal command to install the latest version. Make sure to install with CUDA support selected if you want to use NVIDIA GPU-accelerated auto-encoder training. Auto-encoder training can still be done on the CPU, but will be a bit slower.)
2. Numpy (with pip python package manager, run "pip install numpy" in a terminal)
3. OpenCV (with pip python package manager, run "pip install opencv-python" in a terminal)
4. libSVM (with pip python package manager, run "pip install libsvm libsvm-official" in a terminal)

Steps to run:
1. Download the project and unzip it.
2. On Windows, double click "run.bat"
3. On other platforms, open a terminal and move to the directory "src", then enter "python main.py"
